Documentation/help text on the edit package page?

Want to be able to see packages with build problems, and packages without build problems
 - on the search page? would a display of all tags help with this?
 - or on the main page?

Some way of getting a list of all packages
 - "you should have the "285 package in the index" have a link like "hiding main-distribution (show)""

Want to be able to sort result tables

you should be able to specify git repos over http/https
you should be able to specify subdirs in git repos
you should check the existence of repos/github repos/urls/etc via XHR

change from "snapshot" to "zip file", depending. ("download" i guess if it's not a zip)

don't let people enter blank version numbers

Much more input validation is needed

## Design possibilities

"the big gray box should probably not go all the way to the top of the page"

The spacing between "sign in" and "register" looks odd
